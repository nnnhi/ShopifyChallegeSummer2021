# What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

- Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://auth0.com/docs/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, among others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
- Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://auth0.com/docs/connections/database/custom-db/create-db-connection)**.
- Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://auth0.com/docs/users/user-account-linking)** with the same user.
- Support for generating signed [Json Web Tokens](https://auth0.com/docs/tokens/json-web-tokens) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
- Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
- Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://auth0.com/docs/rules).
